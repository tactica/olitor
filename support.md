# Olitor - Mediterranean Diet

Mediterranean diet has shown to improve health in many people.
With this application we are hoping to make healthy eating an easy and affordable habit to follow.

## What is the Mediterranean Diet?

"Mediterranean diet" is a generic diet based on the traditional eating habits in the countries bordering the
Mediterranean Sea. The foundation of the Mediterranean diet is daily consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts,
legumes and whole grains. Moderate (once or twice a week) amounts of fish, seafood, dairy, poultry and eggs
are also central to the Mediterranean Diet. In contrast, red meat and sweets are eaten only occasionally (once
or twice a month). Olive oil is the primary source of added fat in the Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean
diet typically allows red wine in moderation.

## Why should I follow this diet?

The Mediterranean diet can help fight against heart disease, certain
cancers, diabetes, and cognitive decline. The Mediterranean diet is endorsed as one of the healthiest diets by many health organizations and
dietitians.
